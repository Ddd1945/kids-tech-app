# Kids Tech App

### `npm run dev`

starts a local web server with HMR for development

### `npm run build`

builds the project, and outputs to the folder ./dist

### `npm run preview`

# Task 
There is an API endpoint
GET https://logiclike.com/docs/courses.json
The endpoint API returns a list of platform educational courses. Each course
has “tags”, topics to which this course relates. For example, a chess course refers to
topics “Puzzles”, “Chess” and “Logic and Thinking”.
Your task is to develop a simple page, according to the layout, that displays a list
courses and allows you to filter courses by selected topic (tags). All content
including the list of topics should be generated dynamically based on the response from the backend.
Layout:
https://www.figma.com/file/gngIKlPiSuWmtoJPIfWHs8/Interview-Frontend?type=design&nod
e-id=711-535&mode=design&t=RUg2M0Dhe5nPRGyb-4
Behavior at different screen resolutions is shown as a separate frame. Block with
“tags” is fixed in width. The block on the right takes up everything else
place. Exactly 3 courses are displayed in one line, which are divided among themselves
accessible place.
Requirements:
● Use react, typescript, scss
● pixel perfect
● Write the code as you would write it on a real project
● You can use any libraries that you consider necessary for
implementation
● Browser support: the code must work in the latest version of Chrome
● The code must be placed in codesandbox, or in a repository
github/gitlab/bitbucket
● Pay attention to code optimization; the code should not do unnecessary
over-renderings that could have been avoided
start a local web server that serves the built solution from ./dist for previewing
